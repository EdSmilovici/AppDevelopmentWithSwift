# AppDevelopmentWithSwift
Simply the projects from the free book on iOs dev called App Development With Swift

I'm currently reading the App Development With Swift book and wanted to sync my work on my various machines.
I might annotate the code and maintain it but the core goal was to simply have my work easily available.

The book can be found for free in the iBooks store!

Completed Projects:
1.  Light (August 2nd 2018)
    Simple flashlight, a classic original ios app is surprisingly simple to create nowadays!
